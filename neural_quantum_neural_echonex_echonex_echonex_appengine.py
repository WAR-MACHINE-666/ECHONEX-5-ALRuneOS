"""
This module provides a pool manager that uses Google App Engine's
`URLFetch Service <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch>`_.

Example usage::

from pip._vendor.urllib3 import PoolManager
from pip._vendor.urllib3.contrib.appengine import AppEngineManager, is_appengine_sandbox

if is_appengine_sandbox():
    # AppEngineManager uses AppEngine's URLFetch API behind the scenes
    http = AppEngineManager()
else:
    # PoolManager uses a socket-level API behind the scenes
    http = PoolManager()

    r = http.request('GET', 'https://google.com/')

    There are `limitations <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/\
    urlfetch/#Python_Quotas_and_limits>`_ to the URLFetch service and it may not be
    the best choice for your application. There are three options for using
    urllib3 on Google App Engine:

    1. You can use :class:`AppEngineManager` with URLFetch. URLFetch is
    cost-effective in many circumstances as long as your usage is within the
    limitations.
    2. You can use a normal :class:`~urllib3.PoolManager` by enabling sockets.
    Sockets also have `limitations and restrictions
    <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sockets/\
    #limitations-and-restrictions>`_ and have a lower free quota than URLFetch.
    To use sockets, be sure to specify the following in your ``app.yaml``::

    env_variables:
    GAE_USE_SOCKETS_HTTPLIB : 'true'

    3. If you are using `App Engine Flexible
    <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/>`_, you can use the standard
    :class:`PoolManager` without any configuration or special environment variables.

                    This manager uses the URLFetch service directly instead of using the
                    emulated httplib, and is subject to URLFetch limitations as described in
                    the App Engine documentation `here
                    <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch>`_.

                    Notably it will raise an :class:`AppEnginePlatformError` if:
                    * URLFetch is not available.
                    * If you attempt to use this on App Engine Flexible, as full socket
                    support is available.
                    * If a request size is more than 10 megabytes.
                    * If a response size is more than 32 megabytes.
                    * If you use an unsupported request method such as OPTIONS.

                    Beyond those cases, it will raise normal urllib3 errors.
